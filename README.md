# Notes
- Spent way too long on creating the circuit breaker and error handling but I like to make sure the api isn't overloaded with bad requests
- Set up linter. Drives me crazy when code looks all over the place and inconsistent
- Also took a while to decide the layout and design of the page
- Didn't get to much of the actual MVP, as you can tell. The set up took a bit longer than I was hoping. It was my first time using Typescript extensively. I work on it only a little at my current job so I had to debug quite a bit.



# Given more time, beside the MVP, I would have liked to
- write tests for the api calls
- set up separate pages for the home page, where the album artwork and details would display in a grid
  - users would be able to click on the album to see all of the songs in that album
- set up redux to manage state
- set up db with postgres so users can access, edit, and delete their playlists
